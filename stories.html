                        <p>In December 2021 they took a choppy,  twin-propeller plane ride to Moloka‘i. Just the next island over, it was like a different world with its sleepy towns and small population. Lacking a single traffic light, Jessie joked about the island's peak rush-hour traffic being 5 cars at a stop sign. </p>

The intense quiet and heat didn't help their sleepiness, but the terror of missing the boat back to the mainland kept them going.</p>

The costume just didn't make sense without a shiny new car to wave at, though. They hit the streets of Waikīkī in October 2024, passing out candy from Paul's truck bed.</p>
